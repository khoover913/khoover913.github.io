  <h4>Poems by Lewis Carrol</h4>

Jabberwocky
'Twas brillig, <em>and the</em> slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And <strong>the</strong> mome raths outgrabe.
</header>

'Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
Beware the Jubjub bird, <strong>and</strong> shun
The frumious Bandersnatch!'
<ul>
<li>He took his vorpal sword in hand:</li>
Long time the manxome foe he sought --
So rested <em>he by</em> the Tumtum tree,
<li>And stood a while in thought.</li>
</ul>

And, as in uffish thought he stood,
The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
And burbled <strong>as</strong> it came!

One <a href=http://www.apple.com >two!</a> One two! And through and through
The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
He left it dead, and with its head
He went galumphing back.

'And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?
Come <strong>to</strong> my arms, my beamish boy!
Oh frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!'
He chortled <em>in</em> his joy.

'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
All mimsy <em>were the</em> borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.

The Walrus and the Carpenter
<img src="pic/walrus.jpg" alt="a walrus" id="walrus">
The sun was shining on the sea,
Shining with all his might:
He <em>did</em> his very best to make
The billows smooth and bright --
And this was odd, because it was
The middle <strong>of</strong> the night.

The moon was shining sulkily,
Because she thought the sun
Had got <strong>no</strong> business to be there
After the day <em>was</em> done --
'It's very rude of him.' she said,
'To come and spoil the fun!'

The sea was wet <em>as</em> wet could be,
The sands were dry as dry.
You could not see a cloud, because
No cloud was in the sky:
No birds were flying overhead --
There were no birds to <a href=http://www.untied.com>fly</a>.
<ol>
<li>The</li><li> Walrus and the Carpenter</li>
<li>Were walking close</li><li> at hand:</li>
<li>They wept <em>like</em> anything to see</li>
<li>Such </li><li>quantities of sand:
'If this were only cleared away,'
They said, <strong>'it</strong> would be grand.'</li>
</ol>

<div id="div1">'If seven maids with seven mops
Swept it for half <em>a</em> year,
Do you suppose,' the Walrus said,
'That they could</div> get it clear?'
'l doubt it,' said the Carpenter,
And shed a bitter tear.

'O Oysters, come and walk with us!
The Walrus did beseech.
'A pleasant walk, <div id="div2">a pleasant talk,
Along the briny beach:</div>
We cannot <em>do with more</em> than four,
To give a hand to each.'

The eldest Oyster looked at him,
But never a word he said:
The eldest Oyster winked his eye,
And shook his heavy head --
Meaning to say <strong>he</strong> did not choose
To leave the oyster-bed.

Out <div id="div3">four young Oysters hurried up.
All eager <em>for</em> the treat:
Their coats were brushed, their faces washed,
Their shoes were clean and neat --
And this was odd, because, you know,</div>
They hadn't any feet.

Four other Oysters followed them,
<img src="pic/oyster.jpg" alt="oyster" id="oyster">
And yet another four;
And thick and fast they came at last,
<div id="div4">And <em>more,</em> and more, and more --
All hopping through the frothy waves,
And scrambling to the shore.

The Walrus and the Carpenter
Walked on a mile or so,
And then they rested on a rock
Conveniently low:</div>
And all the little Oysters stood
And waited in <strong>a</strong> row.

'The time has come,' the Walrus said,
'To talk of many things:
Of shoes -- and ships -- and sealing wax --
Of cabbages -- and kings --
And why the <em>sea</em> is boiling hot --
And whether pigs have wings.'

'But wait a bit,' the Oysters cried,
'Before we have our chat;
For some of us are out of breath,
And all <strong>of</strong> us are fat!'
'No hurry!' said the Carpenter.
They thanked him much for that.

'A loaf of bread,' the Walrus said,
<p>'Is what we chiefly need:
Pepper and vinegar besides
Are very good indeed --</p>
Now, if you're ready, Oysters dear,
We can begin to feed.'

'But not on us!' the Oysters cried,
Turning a little blue.
'After such kindness, that would be
<em>A</em> dismal thing to do!'
<section>'The night is fine,' the Walrus said,
'Do you admire the view?'</section>

<p>'It was so kind of you to come!
And you are very nice!'
The Carpenter said nothing but
'Cut us <em>another</em> slice-</p>
I wish you were not quite so deaf-
I've had to ask you twice!'
<footer>
<div id="div5">'It seems a shame,' the Walrus said,
'To play them such a trick.
After we've brought them out so far,
And made them trot <strong>so</strong> quick!'
The Carpenter said nothing but
'The <a href= http://www.pinterest.com>butter's</a> spread too thick!'
<ul>
<li>'I </li><li>weep for you</li><li>,'the Walrus said:
<section>'I deeply sympathize.'</section>
With sobs and tears</li> <li>he sorted out</li>
<li>Those of</li><li> the</li><li> largest size,
Holding his pocket-handkerchief
Before his streaming eyes.</li>
</ul>

<p>'O Oysters,' said the Carpenter,
'You've had <a href=http://www.disney.com>a</a> pleasant run!
Shall we be trotting home again?'
But answer came there none --
And <strong>this</strong> was scarcely odd, because</p></div>
They'd eaten every one.
